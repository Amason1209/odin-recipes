    <h1>Fathead Pizza!</h1>
    <p> Fathead pizza has a long line of being the go to snack or meal for people on the Keto diet. The Keto diet focuses on fats and protein as a substitution of Carbs.
        It is <strong>extremely</strong> important to be aware of your carb intake while on this diet - which is why making sure pizza doesn't suck without dough is important! </p>
        <p> Let's take a look at what we all need for this type of pizza!
            <ul>
                <li> 1 1/2 Cups of Mozarella Cheese (shredded)</li>
                <li> 2 tbsp Cream Cheese </li>
                <li> 1 Large Egg (Beaten)</li>
                <li> 3/4 cup Almond Flour</li>
            </p>
    <p> Not that many ingredients for the dough! You are free to add any toppings but the dough is the important part. Just avoid Pineapple on pizza....as we all know...it <strong>does not</strong> belong on pizza...<p>
    <h3>How to Make</h3>
<ol>
    <li> First, mix the shredded mozzarella cheese and cream cheese together and then microwave them for about 90 seconds. Broiling works too, but just make sure theyre well melted together and creamy.</li>
    <li>While that's melting, stir the almond flour and egg together. Make sure it's well mixed. As soon as the cheese is ready, throw that in too. You really want to work the dough so there's no streaks. If it gets too cold, you can microwave it a few seconds to make it pliable again.</li>
    <li>Once your dough is ready, you can roll it out on a pizza stone. Make sure you use parchment paper as this is <em>extremely</em> sticky. I wet my hands with olive oil to make sure it doesn't stick. Plus I prefer kneeding out dough with my hands compared to a roller. But up to you!</li>
    <li>Throw that dough into an oven at around 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Let it cook for about 4 or 5 minutes. Poke holes in the bubbles that will form as you see them. Then let it cook another 10 minutes or so.</li>
    <li>Throw any toppings you want! I prefer a good pesto sauce with goat cheese - but any low-carb sauce such as Alfredo or a homemade Tomato sauce will work. Enjoy!</li>
