    <h1>Omelette! (Possibly Fromage....)</h1>
<p>What's incredibly cheap, filling, and can be mixed with almost anything? <strong>Eggs!</strong> Let's look at an easy recipe that even beginners can do!</p>
<h2>What you'll need</h2>
<p><ul>
<li>4 or 5 Large Eggs (Beaten)</li>
<li>Salt (I prefer sea salt)</li>
<li>Black Ground Pepper</li>
<li>Butter or some sort of clear fat (I loooove duck fat)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The thing about omlettes is that there's a lot of ways you can make them. There's the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7pAzpS0aSs">creamy way Gordon Ramsay does it</a> or there's a multitude of other ways! We'll be doing it my way - not too creamy with a little bit of bite.</p>
<p><ol>
<li>First, whisk your eggs in a small bowl. Get the strands of egg whites fully blended into the yolks. </li>
<li>Make sure your pan is on med-med high heat. We want the eggs to cook fast. Some people say not to season your eggs before they start cooking, but I'm not most people. Throw that salt in with a <strong>BAM</strong> 
that would make Emril Lagasse proud. Go ahead and get some <em>pepper pepper pepper</em> in it too.</li>
<li>Melt whatever you're doing into the pan. Butter, grease, fat, whatever. It all works out!</li>
<li>Pour in your eggs and let them settle in the pan for approx. 30 seconds. Quickly drag your spatula or fork from the edges to the middle.
    You should start seeing some of the eggs form and as you center them, move the pan around so the excess liquid spreads around. Do that only for about 30 seconds.</li>
<li>Next is you add whatever you want! I throw some mild cheese, maybe some salami, spinach! Whatever! They're eggs, they're a vehicle for delicious goodness.
    Just make sure to throw them on about half the omelette that's forming.</li>
<li> Give it another 30 seconds to settle and form a base, then slide your spatula on the half without filling and flip it over. Seal the edges with a little pressure and voila.</li>
<li>Once it looks like the insides are heated up and sealed, take off at your hearts desire. IF you want it creamier, take off almost immediately. If you don't mind some brown, let it sit so that cheese melts all the way through.</li>
</ol>
