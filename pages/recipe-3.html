    <h1>Fried Chicken! What more can you ask?</h1>
    <p>Chicken is a worldwide staple that is popular all over. From the States to Korea - it's a cultural phenom that I don't think anyone would hate. But there's one big problem for low-carb dieters - it's usually <strong>covered</strong> with flour, corn meal, and other high carb additions.
    I'll show you a way that still remains tasty - and is low carb. (Honestly, I prefer this to flour coated now...)</p>
    <h3>What you'll need</h3>
    <ul><li><strong>Chicken!</strong> I prefer the use of thighs, but anything works. They're easier to make if theyre skinless at the very least. </li>
    <li><strong>Pork Rinds</strong> - you can buy regular ones from almost any grocery store.</li>
    <li><strong>Heavy Cream</strong> or <strong>Eggs</strong> - we need to have a binding agent for the pork rinds</li>
    <li><strong>Salt and Pepper</strong> and any other seasonings you want in the breading</li>
    <li><strong>Duck fat</strong>....if you aint fried with duck fat you're not real.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may look at this list and go "This all seems wildly unhealthy." Well! Ok maybe it isn't the best, but damn if it doesn't taste good AND keeps you in Keto. Let's get a move on, I'm hungry!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure your chicken is thawed and dry. We don't need it wet. Dab that with a paper towel just to make sure. Liberally season each with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Prepare your wet and dry stations. Either beat eggs in a bowl or pour heavy cream into one. In the other, smash up pork rinds until they're quite fine. I add a little red pepper powder into the breading and hot sauce into the cream for an extra kick.</li>
        <li>Designate one hand to be your wet and one hand to be your dry. You're going to dip your chicken into the breading first with your dry hand, then dip it into your binding agent in the wet. Then one last time in the breading. It's a nice double coat. </li>
        <li>Set your chicken aside once it has a nice breading on it. Melt your duck fat in a semi-deep pan. Get that fat nice and hot (med-high heat). Drop your chicken in. <strong>DO NOT CROWD THE PAN!!</strong> This chicken is raw - it needs time to cook. The breading also likes to get brown - and eventually burnt - pretty quickly. Let each piece breath and cook.</li>
        <li>Depending on how thick your chicken is, I cook mine about 10 minutes. Let the cooked down side get a golden brown. Flip and repeat. Constantly take temps of that chicken. Make sure it crosses the 165 F threshold. (I usually take mine off around 155-160 since it internally keeps cooking for a bit off the pan.)</li>
        <li>Let it rest for a few minutes on a cooling rack. Let those juices settle. In the meantime, you can throw up a mayo aioli dipping sauce or any other low-carb preference. Serve it up!</li>
    </ol>
